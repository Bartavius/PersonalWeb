        <ul>
          <li>Design card</li>
          <li>
            The card (pre-click) should just have title, tags of technologies
            used, and perhabs a subheading like "hackathon submission", etc
          </li>
          <li>
            Should have a button to open up the website if hosted, and github
            repo
          </li>
          <li>
            Clicking on it brings up a modal window (add zoom in animation?)
          </li>

          <li>
            once clicked, the details should include
            <ol>
              <li>Same stuff as pre-click</li>
              <li>collaborators</li>
              <li>slightly (but still relatively short) description of what the project is</li>
              <li>a section about what I learned (this doesn't help with hireability, it's just a personal touch)</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
